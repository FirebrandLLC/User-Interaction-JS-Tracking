Tracking User Interactions for Impersonator Bot Detection
===========================
Motivation
----------
Google Analytics reports are polluted with a lot of "Direct" traffic that doesn't appear to correlate with other visitor information.

This script implements a method to discriminate between users interacting with an app or web page and bots just accessing a page.

Installation
------------
This script was designed to generate a custom dimension for [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/). And is implemented using [Google Tag Manager](https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/)

### Set up a Google Analytics custom dimension
