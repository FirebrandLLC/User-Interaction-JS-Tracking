Tracking User Interactions for Impersonator Bot Detection
===========================
Motivation
----------
Google Analytics reports are polluted with a lot of "Direct" traffic that doesn't appear to correlate with other visitor information.

This script implements a method, using Google Analytics Events, to discriminate between users interacting with an app or web page and bots just accessing a page.

Learn more about our [research](https://firebrand.net).

Features
----------
 - Easily implemented on most sites using Google Tag Manager or inserting the code in your site's theme
 - Reports can use simple tests for events without setting up custom dimensions
 
Requirements
------------
 - jQuery - Script uses jQuery to capture interaction events
 - Google Analytics - The data is sent to Google Universal Analytics
 - Google Tag Manager - This implementation uses Google Tag Manager

Installation
------------
This script was designed to generate a custom segment for [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/). And is implemented using [Google Tag Manager](https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/)

### Set up Google Tag Manager
If you haven't already set up Google Tag Manager (GTM), Google has some [helpful instructions](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821?hl=en).

Create a generic GA Event tag to send the data to Google Analytics. Simo Ahava [explains how](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/create-a-generic-event-tag/). 
Or you can import our [pre-packaged version](https://github.com/FirebrandLLC/GTM-GAEvent).  Just Import Container and select "merge." Then update the Global Settings variable with your Analytics ID and any other settings.

### Add the script tag to Google Tag Manager

1. From the Tags tab, create a new tag

 ![New Tag](screenshots/new-tag.png "New Tag")

2. Name it "Active User Events"

 ![Tag Name](screenshots/tag-name.png "Tag Name")

3. Set the type to Custom HTML

 ![Tag Type](screenshots/tag-type.png "Tag Type")

4. Paste the contents of [user-interaction.js](https://github.com/FirebrandLLC/User-Interaction-JS-Tracking/blob/master/user-interaction.js) into the HTML edit box. Add script tags around the JavaScript.

5. Set the trigger to "All Pages"

6. Then save and publish your tag. Of course, you should preview your changes and make sure there are no errors first.

### Use the events in your reports
Your Google Analytics sessions will now include new events:
<dl>
<dt>Category:</dt>
<dd>Firebrand User Events</dd>
<dt>Action:</dt>
<dd>
  + MouseMove
  + Touch
  + Scroll
  + KeyDown
  + Click
  + 5 seconds
  + 19 seconds
  + 39 seconds
  + 67 seconds
  + etc.
 </dd>
<dt>Label:</dt>
<dd>

  + Active Interaction
  + Inactive Interaction
</dd>
</dl>

Any session with an Active Interaction event is probably a human.
