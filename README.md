Tracking User Interactions for Impersonator Bot Detection
===========================
Motivation
----------
Google Analytics reports are polluted with a lot of "Direct" traffic that doesn't appear to correlate with other visitor information.

This script implements a method to discriminate between users interacting with an app or web page and bots just accessing a page.

Installation
------------
This script was designed to generate a custom segment for [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/). And is implemented using [Google Tag Manager](https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/)

### Add the script tag to Google Tag manager
If you haven't already set up Google Tag Manager (GTM), Google has some [helpful instructions](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821?hl=en).
1. From the Tags tab, create a new tag
![New Tag](screenshots/new-tag.png "New Tag")
1. Name it "Active User Events"
![Tag Name](screenshots/tag-name.png "Tag Name")
1. Set the type to Custom HTML
![Tag Type](screenshots/tag-type.png "Tag Type")
1. Paste the contents of user-interaction.js into the HTML edit box
![Tag HTML](screenshots/tag-html.png "Tag HTML")
1. Set the trigger to All Pages
![Tag Trigger](screenshots/tag-trigger.png "Tag Trigger")
1. Then save your tag


### Set up a Google Analytics custom dimension
